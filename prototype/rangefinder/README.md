the arduino code takes an input ('0') then measures the distance and prints this in the serial i added a , to seperate the values of the two ultrasonic sensors ( one front one back).

the code for the pi writes the ('0') value that triggers the arduino then returns the data that the arduino code sends. Then i seperate the two values in the while loop and print them out.
