when holding the pcb with the side WITHOUT a sensor facing towards you, looking down upon the pcb, you should see the 9 output terminals facing towards you (probably with wires in them). In this case, the LEFT-most output terminal is pin 9, the pin right of that pin 8, etc, and the RIGHT-most pin is pin 1 as listed above.
